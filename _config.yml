  I'm a seasoned journalist and software engineer building tools and applications for reporters in Washington.
  <br><br>
  At National Journal, I cover national security issues, at the State Department, the Pentagon, and in the halls of Congress. I'm also a self-taught software engineer. As someone with a foot in both worlds, Iâ€™ll bring a fresh set of skills to your team and we'll build amazing software.
